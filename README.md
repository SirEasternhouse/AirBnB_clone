     AirBnB Clone Command Interpreter

    
    This project is a command-line interpreter (CLI) designed to manage objects within an AirBnB clone ecosystem. The CLI allows users to perform various operations on     objects, including creating new instances, retrieving existing instances, performing operations like counting and computing statistics, updating attributes, and des    troying objects.

    # Features

    - BaseModel Class: A parent class handling initialization, serialization, and deserialization of instances.
    - Serialization/Deserialization Flow: Converts instances to dictionaries, JSON strings, and files, and vice versa.
    - AirBnB Classes: Classes representing various components of the AirBnB ecosystem, such as User, State, City, Place, etc.
    - Storage Engine: Implements a basic storage engine, initially as file storage, responsible for storing and retrieving instances of objects.
    - Unit Tests: Includes unit tests to validate the functionality of all classes and the storage engine.
